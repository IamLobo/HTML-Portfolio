<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>

A pirate's life, a salty dream, <br/>
On Caribbean waves, a sunlit gleam. <br/>
Captain Jack, with swagger and a grin, <br/>
A compass pointing, where fortunes begin.<br/>
"Yo ho ho," the rum flows free, <br/>
Adventure calls, for all to see.<br/>
From cursed ships to hidden gold,<br/>
A pirate's tale, forever told. <br/>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>

Something about a child who lost his parents and trying to revenge them, while everyone else is dying around him.
